# IPV6PrefixFilter
[README](README.md) | [中文文档](README_ZH.md)

This program is a filter that drops router advertisement that trying to set a non-specified IPv6 prefix. Sometimes a misconfigured router will send you the wrong RA for the wrong prefix setting, or someone will intentionally send you the wrong RA to interfere with your network.
